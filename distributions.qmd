## Statistical distributions

-   Julia has a fantastic unified system for statistical distributions, implemented mainly in the `Distributions.jl` package.

-   Similar to Python, but different from R, **distributions are objects**.

-   We can call functions on a `dist = Normal()` object, for example

    -   `pdf(dist, 2.0)` computes the pdf at `x=2.0`

    -   `cdf(dist, 2.0)` computes the cdf at `x=2.0`

    -   `rand(dist)` generates random numbers from N(0,1)

    -   `mean(dist)` and `var(dist)` returns the mean and variance.

    ```{julia}
    using Distributions
    dist = Normal(1,3) 
    pdf(dist, 0)
    cdf(dist, 0) 
    quantile(dist, 0.5)
    rand(dist, 10) 
    ```

-   Scale-locations families are generated by addition and multiplication

    ```{julia}
    using Distributions

    1 + 2*TDist(3)
    TDist(μ, σ, ν) = μ + σ*TDist(ν)
    TDist(3)
    dist = TDist(1, 2, 3)
    pdf(dist, 0)
    ```

## Optimization and Autodiff

The [Optim.jl](https://julianlsolvers.github.io/Optim.jl/stable/) package is the main package for numerical function optimization.

## Working with R in Julia

The [Rcall.jl](https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/stable/) package makes it possible to use R code, functions and packages from a Julia program.
