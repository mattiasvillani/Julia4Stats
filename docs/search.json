The prompt changes to help?&gt; and you can search for documentation about functions etc; see animated gif below. Backspace takes you back to Julian mode.\nPkg mode, activated by typing a right bracket ]. This opens the package manager where Julia packages are added and managed.\nShell mode, activated by typing a semicolon ;. The prompt changes to shell&gt; and you can use the usual shell commands for navigating directories, copying files etc. (On Windows, type powershell or cmd at shell&gt; to get access to the shell).\nSearch mode, activated by ctrl+r, as explained above.\nR mode.

    "section": " The package manager",
    "text": "The package manager\n\nSimilar to R, but a bit more extreme, most things in Julia are available in packages.\nPackages are typically named with a .jl ending, for example the Distributions.jl package contains many statistical distributions.\nJulia packages are hosted on GitHub and managed by the Julia General Registry.\n\nHere are some of the most common packages for Statistics:\n\nStatistics.jl (mean, variance, quantile etc)\nDistributions.jl (most standard statistical distributions, with rand, pdf, cdf etc)\nLinearAlgebra.jl\nDataFrames.jl (tabular data manipulation)\nTidier.jl (R’s tidyverse, Julia-style)\nPlots.jl (one of the most widely used plotting systems)\nOptim.jl (numerical optimization)\nGLM.jl (generalized linear models using R’s formula syntax)\nTuring.jl (probabilistic programming, similar to Stan)\nRCall.jl (using R code in Julia)\nDifferentiationInterface.jl (interface to Julia’s many autodiff libraries)\nRDatasets.jl (the R datasets that we all love, in Julia)\n\nThe package manager is most easily accessed by typing ] to get into Pkg mode. The prompt changes to (@v1.12) pkg&gt; which means that you are in package mode in the default environment v.1.12 (if you are using Julia 1.12, more on environments later).\nSome useful commands in Pkg mode:\n\nstatus, shows the packages installed in the currently active environment\nadd PkgName (installs the PkgName.jl package, for example Distributions.jl)\nadd GitHubLink adds the package directly from Github, e.g. add git@github.com:JuliaStats/Distributions.jl.git\nrm PkgName (removes the PkgName.jl package)\nupdate (checks registry and updates packages)\n\nWhen we write, for example, ] add Distributions we mean to type ] and then add Distributions on the pkg&gt; prompt.\nOnce a package has been added it can be used from the Julian prompt (just backspace out from Pkg mode) with the using command: using PkgName . This loads the package in memory and its functions and other objects can now be used.\nThere are other ways to use a package, like import. The main difference is that\n\nusing exposes all exported function directly without needing to call then with the package name as prefix, e.g. myfunc(3).\nimport does not expose exported function directly and requires a call to function to be prefixed with the package name, e.g. PkgName.myfunc(3). This is closer to Python’s namespace convention, but namespaces are less essential in Julia due to multiple dispatch and Julia’s clever handling of function (method) name collisions.\nIt is also possible to use only specific functions from a package: using PkgName: myfunc, otherfunc.\nHere is comparison of package handling in R, Julia and Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nRepository\n\nInstall packages\n\nUse packages\n\n\nR\n\nCRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)\n\ninstall.packages(\"pkgname\")\n\nlibrary(pkgname)\n\n\nJulia\n\nGeneral registry (hosted on GitHub)\n\n] add PkgName\n\nusing PkgName\nimport PkgName\nimport PkgName: myfunc\n\n\nPython\n\nPyPI (Python Package Index)\nor Conda\n\npip install pkgname\nconda install pkgname\n\nfrom pkgname import *\nimport pkgname as pk\nfrom pkgname import myfunc\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironments\n\nPackages are by default add:ed to the default environment (e.g. v1.12 if you use Julia 1.12). However, it is common to have several projects ongoing at the same time, and different projects needs different packages. Here is where environments are very useful.\nA Julia environment is basically a list of all the packages used in a project, potentially including detailed information about which version of the packages that are to be used in the project. An environment is created by going to a directory and typing activate . in the Pkg prompt. The dot means here (in the directory structure; alternatively, the dot can be replaced by a path where you want the environment to live). The activate command creates two files:\n\nProject.toml - This is a list of the packages added to the project (so called direct dependencies), and their compatibility. Each package is identified by a unique ID. The link goes to the Project.toml used for this tutorial.\nManifest.toml - This contains the complete dependency structure of the added packages (since your added packages will often depend on other packages, so called indirect dependencies). The manifest.toml file can be used to instantiate all packages and their dependencies to the exact versions used in a particular project, so that code can be exactly reproduced with a frozen state of dependencies.\n\nWhen two projects use the same package at the same version, the content of this package is not duplicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nAdd the Distributions.jl package in the package manager. Type status after install to see that it indeed was added.\nUse the Distributions.jl package by the using command from the Julian prompt.\nUse the package to define a normal distribution object with mean 2 and and standard deviation 3. Go into help mode and search for Normal to see how this is done. Call the new object dist.\nGenerate 10 random draws from this normal distribution using the rand function on the normal distribution object dist.\nEvaluate the pdf of this normal at x=1 using the pdf function on the normal distribution object dist."

It can be installed from here. There are many many extensions or plug-ins for VS code for doing mostly anything you want. Here is a 100 sec video about VS code. The official getting started guide is quite good.\nThe most important command in VS code is ctrl+shift+p which opens the Command palette. From there you can type things like settings to access all the settings, execute code etc.\n\n\nJulia in VS Code\nThe most important extension for Julia is the official Julia extension, which brings together the editor, Julia REPL, plot pane, debugging tools, and much more in one app. Once you open a .jl file in the editor, VS code will give you proper syntax highlighting. Here is 2+ minute getting started video. With the Julia extension installed, try ctrl+shift+p and type julia in the command palette to see some of the commands that you can use for Julia in VS code.\nThe official documention is here.\nHere are some useful commands, keyboard shortcuts and extensions in VS code.\n\nJulia code in VS code can be run in three basic ways:\n\nRun a file in a separate terminal: from command palette: Julia: Run File in New Process or from the Play button in the top right corner of the editor.\nDebug mode.\nRun interatively in the REPL inside VS code.\n\n\n\nshift + enter or alt + enter on a line in the editor starts the Julia REPL automatically. However, if you close the REPL, you have to use the command Julia: Restart REPL in the Command palette to start a new one.\nIf you prefer to not have the output inline in the editor, go to Julia extension settings and search for Execution: Result Type, and set it to REPL (the default is Both REPL and inline).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nOpen the plotfunc.jl file from a previous exercise in VS Code and run it again using the command Julia: Run File in New Process\nNow, run each line in plotfunc.jl interactively in the VS code Julia REPL.

    "text": "Star\n\nThis tutorial was initially prepared as part of the COST action HiTEc for the Econometrics & Statistics (EcoSta) conference in Tokyo, and updated to a second version for the Joint Conference CFE-CMStatistics 2025 in London, with an additional module on Probabilistic Programming contributed by the Turing.jl team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAim\nThis tutorial introduces the Julia programming language and its use for statistical analysis.  The following topics will be covered:\n\nintroduction to the Julia programming language\nthe package manager and tooling\nmanaging data and plotting in Julia\nstatistical distributions\nnumerical optimization and automatic differentiation\nworking with R and Python in Julia\n\n\n\nInstructor\n\nMattias Villani Professor of Statistics Stockholm University\n\n\nBefore the tutorial\nYou may want to install Julia, some packages, and VS code before the tutorial, to follow along in the interactive demos and also experiment yourself.\n\nInstall Julia. Here are the instructions.\n(optional) Install VS code (IDE similar to RStudio for R). Instructions are here.\nActivate an environment and install some Julia packages:\n\n\nDownload this Project.toml file to your directory of choice. This file lists some of the most important packages used in the tutorial.\nStart Julia by typing julia in the terminal.\nIn Julia, change working directory to your chosen directory by typing cd(\"PathToYourDirectory\").\nIn Julia, type ] and press Enter to enter the package manager. The prompt should change to something with pkg&gt;.\nactivate the environment by typing activate . and Enter. (that is activate followed by space and a dot).\nstill at the pkg&gt; prompt, type update to install the most important packages for the tutorial, including Turing.jl. Go back to the julia&gt; prompt by pressing Backspace.\n\nIf you want all packages used in the tutorial (takes longer) in exactly the same state as in my presentation, do this:\n\nDownload the Manifest.toml file and place it in your directory of choice. This file list all packages and their dependencies with the same version used in the tutorial.\nStart Julia by typing julia in the terminal.\nIn Julia, cd to your directory by typing cd(\"PathToYourDirectory\").\nIn Julia, type ] and press Enter to enter the package manager. The prompt should change to something with pkg&gt;.\nactivate the environment by typing activate . and Enter. (that is activate followed by space and a dot).\nstill at the pkg&gt; prompt, type instantiate and Enter to install all packages used in the tutorial, with the exact same versions. Go back to the julia&gt; prompt by pressing Backspace.\n\n\n\nPlan and material\n\nLecture 1 - The Julia programming language and tooling Reading: Getting started with Julia  Live demo: Basic Julia\nLecture 2 - Working with data in Julia Reading: Read, managing and plotting data  Code: DataFrames.jl | Tidier.jl | Plots\nLecture 3 - Statistics in Julia Reading: Distributions and Optimization | Interop with R and Python  Code: Distributions | Optimization | Working with R and Python\n\n\nMore material\nBooks, courses and podcasts etc about Julia A collection of Julia links Writing Julia packages More on packages and the package manager"
