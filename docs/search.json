    "text": "The package manager: a first look\nSimilar to R, but a bit more extreme, most things in Julia are available in packages. Packages are typically named with a .jl ending, for example the Distributions.jl package contains many statistical distributions. Julia packages are hosted on GitHub and managed by the Julia General Registry.\nHere are some of the most common packages for Statistics:\n\nStatistics.jl (mean, variance, quantile etc)\nDistributions.jl (most standard statistical distributions, with rand, pdf, cdf etc)\nLinearAlgebra.jl\nDataFrames.jl (tabular data manipulation)\nTidier.jl (R‚Äôs tidyverse, Julia-style)\nPlots.jl (one of the most widely used plotting systems)\nOptim.jl (numerical optimization)\nGLM.jl (generalized linear models using R‚Äôs formula syntax)\nTuring.jl (probabilistic programming, similar to Stan)\nRCall.jl (using R code in Julia)\nDifferentiationInterface.jl (interface to Julia‚Äôs many autodiff libraries)\nRDatasets.jl (the R datasets that we all love, in Julia)\n\nThe package manager is most easily accessed by typing ] to get into Pkg mode.

This loads the package in memory and its functions and other objects can now be used.\nThere are other ways to use a package, like import. The main difference is that\n\nusing exposes all exported function directly without needing to call then with the package name as prefix, e.g.¬†myfunc(3).\nimport does not expose exported function directly and requires a call to function to be prefixed with the package name, e.g.¬†PkgName.myfunc(3). This is closer to Python‚Äôs namespace convention, but namespaces are less essential in Julia due to multiple dispatch and Julias clever handling of function (method) name collisions.\nIt is also possible to use only specific functions from a package: using PkgName: myfunc, otherfunc.\nHere is comparison of package handling in R, Julia and Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nRepository\n\nInstall packages\n\nUse packages\n\n\nR\n\nCRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)\n\ninstall.packages(\"pkgname\")\n\nlibrary(pkgname)\n\n\nJulia\n\nGeneral registry (hosted on GitHub)\n\n] add PkgName\n\nusing PkgName\nimport PkgName\nimport PkgName: myfunc\n\n\nPython\n\nPyPI (Python Package Index)\nor Conda\n\npip install pkgname\nconda install pkgname\n\nfrom pkgname import *\nimport pkgname as pk\nfrom pkgname import myfunc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nAdd the Distributions.jl package in the package manager.

In short:\n\n Linux: run the following command in terminal:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\nMac: run the following command in terminal:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n Windows, type this in the terminal to install from Windows store:\nwinget install --name Julia --id 9NJNWW8PVKMN -e -s msstore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid Linux repositories\n\n\n\nIt is not recommended to install Julia from repositories on Linux since the versions there can be rather old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninstall juliaup\n\n\n\nJuliaup can be uninstalled with the terminal command: juliaup self uninstall\n\n\nJulia can now be started by typing julia in the terminal (you may need to restart the shell/terminal so your system can find it). You should see something like this:\n\nThis what is known as the console in the R world. In Julia we tend to call it the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). The REPL is where you can interactively execute code and view the output. We will soon use VS Code as our main working environment (IDE, similar to RStudio, but much more general), but let‚Äôs take a first dive into Julia directly in the REPL."

Ctrl+r gives more advanced reverse-search.\npast commands can be edited and re-used.\n\n\nThe REPL has several prompt modes, for example:\n\nJulian mode, which is the default seen above.\nHelp mode, activated by typing ? at the prompt. The prompt changes to help?&gt; and you can search for documentation about functions etc. Backspace takes you back to Julian mode.\nShell mode, activated by typing a semicolon ;. The prompt changes to shell&gt; and you can use the usual shell commands for navigating directories, copying files etc. (On Windows, type powershell or cmd at shell&gt; to get access to the shell).\nPkg mode, activated by typing a right bracket ]. This opens the package manager where Julia packages are added and managed.\nSearch mode, activated by ctrl+r, as explained above.\nR mode. Later, when discuss how R and Julia can work together with the RCall.jl package, there will an R mode available by typing $ which opens an R prompt.

Go back to shell mode and change the directory back to where you where before this exercise.\nGo into package mode and type status to see if you have any packages installed.

    "text": "The package manager: a first look\nSimilar to R, but a bit more extreme, most things in Julia are available in packages. Packages are typically named with a .jl ending, for example the Distributions.jl package contains many statistical distributions. Julia packages are hosted on GitHub and managed by the Julia General Registry.\nHere are some of the most common packages for Statistics:\n\nStatistics.jl (mean, variance, quantile etc)\nDistributions.jl (most standard statistical distributions, with rand, pdf, cdf etc)\nLinearAlgebra.jl\nDataFrames.jl (tabular data manipulation)\nTidier.jl (R‚Äôs tidyverse, Julia-style)\nPlots.jl (one of the most widely used plotting systems)\nOptim.jl (numerical optimization)\nGLM.jl (generalized linear models using R‚Äôs formula syntax)\nTuring.jl (probabilistic programming, similar to Stan)\nRCall.jl (using R code in Julia)\nDifferentiationInterface.jl (interface to Julia‚Äôs many autodiff libraries)\nRDatasets.jl (the R datasets that we all love, in Julia)\n\nThe package manager is most easily accessed by typing ] to get into Pkg mode. The prompt changes to (@v.11) pkg&gt; which means that you are in package mode in the default environment v.11 (if you are using Julia 1.11, more on environments later).\nSome useful commands in Pkg mode:\n\nstatus, shows the packages installed in the currently active environment\nadd PkgName (installs the PkgName.jl package, for example Distributions.jl)\nrm PkgName (removes the PkgName.jl package)\nupdate (checks registry and updates packages)\n\nWhen we write, for example, ] add Distributions we mean to type ] and then add Distributions on the Pkg prompt.\nOnce a package has been added it can be used from the Julian prompt (just backspace out from Pkg mode) with the using command: using PkgName . This loads the package in memory and its functions and other objects can now be used.\nThere are other ways to use a package, like import. The main difference is that\n\nusing exposes all exported function directly without needing to call then with the package name as prefix, e.g.¬†myfunc(3).\nimport does not expose exported function directly and requires a call to function to be prefixed with the package name, e.g.¬†PkgName.myfunc(3). This is closer to Python‚Äôs namespace convention, but namespaces are less essential in Julia due to multiple dispatch and Julias clever handling of function (method) name collisions.\nIt is also possible to use only specific functions from a package: using PkgName: myfunc, otherfunc.\nHere is comparison of package handling in R, Julia and Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nRepository\n\nInstall packages\n\nUse packages\n\n\nR\n\nCRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)\n\ninstall.packages(\"pkgname\")\n\nlibrary(pkgname)\n\n\nJulia\n\nGeneral registry (hosted on GitHub)\n\n] add PkgName\n\nusing PkgName\nimport PkgName\nimport PkgName: myfunc\n\n\nPython\n\nPyPI (Python Package Index)\nor Conda\n\npip install pkgname\nconda install pkgname\n\nfrom pkgname import *\nimport pkgname as pk\nfrom pkgname import myfunc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nAdd the Distributions.jl package in the package manager. Type status after install to see that it indeed was added.\nUse the Distributions.jl package by the using command from the Julian prompt.\nUse the package to define a normal distribution object with mean 2 and and standard deviation 3. Go into help mode and search for Normal to see how this is done. Call the new object dist.\nGenerate 10 random draws from this normal distribution using the rand function on the normal distribution object dist.\nEvaluate the pdf of this normal at x=1 using the pdf function on the normal distribution object dist."

Here is 2+ minute getting started video. With the Julia extension installed, try ctrl+shift+p and type julia in the command palette to see some of the commands that you can use for Julia in VS code.\nThe official documention is here.\nHere are some useful commands, keyboard shortcuts and extensions in VS code.\n\nJulia code in VS code can be run in three basic modes:\n\nRun a file in a separate terminal: from command palette: Julia: Run File in New Process or from the Play button in the top right corner of the editor.\nDebug mode.\nRun interatively in the REPL inside VS code.\n\n\n\nshift + enter or shift + ctrl on a line in the editor starts the Julia REPL automatically. However, if you close the REPL, you have to use the command Julia: Restart REPL to start a new one.\nIf you prefer to not have the output inline in the editor, go to Julia extension settings and search for Execution: Result Type, and set it to REPL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nOpen the plotfunc.jl file from a previous exercise in VS Code and run it again using the command Julia: Run File in New Process\nNow, run each line in plotfunc.jl interactively in the VS code Julia REPL."

Literate.jl can return a markdown, a Jupyter or Quarto notebook, or a scrubbed Julia file without the markdown/comments.\n\nThe generate(‚ÄúExamplePackage‚Äù) command in the Package manager REPL initializes a new package.\nThe default package is very bare bone. Better to use a template from PkgTemplates.jl that sets up the author, license, Julia version, and Github actions for testing the code and building documentation automatically when pushed to Github. Here is an example template used to generate a package.\nusing PkgTemplates\nmyTemplate = Template(; \n    user=\"mattiasvillani\",\n    authors=[\"Mattias Villani\"],\n    julia=v\"1.11\",\n    plugins=[\n        License(; name=\"MIT\"),\n        Git(; manifest=true, ssh=true),\n        GitHubActions(; x86=true),\n        Codecov(),\n        Documenter{GitHubActions}(),\n        Develop(),\n    ],\n)\ngenerate(\"ExamplePackage\", myTemplate)\n\nThis generates the following folder structure for the package:\n\nThe folder structure contains:\n\nsrc is the main folder for the source code, with the package‚Äôs main module in the ExamplePackage.jl file.\ndocs is for the documentation, where the file make.jl contains what is needed to build the documentation.

Note that the added .jl, which is standard for repo names on Github.\nUse the Revise.jl package so that changes in your package is picked up by Julia. Revise.jl is a no-brainer, everyone uses it. Most of us put a using Revise in the startup.jl filethat Julia reads before starting Julia (this file lives in ~/.julia/config/startup.jl on Linux, but you need to create the folder and file first time).
