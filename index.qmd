### Aim

This tutorial introduces the Julia programming language and its use for
statistical analysis. <br> The following topics will be covered:

-   introduction to the Julia programming language

-   the package manager and tooling

-   managing data and plotting in Julia

-   statistical distributions

-   numerical optimization and automatic differentiation

-   working with R and Python in Julia

### Before the tutorial

You may want to install Julia, some packages, and VS code before the tutorial, to follow
along in the interactive demos and also experiment yourself.

1. Install Julia. [Here](gettingstarted.qmd#installing-julia) are the instructions.
2. (optional) Install **VS code** (IDE similar to RStudio for R). Instructions are [here](gettingstarted.html#vs-code---rstudiopositron-for-julia).
3. Activate an environment and install some Julia packages:
-   Download this [Project.toml](env_light/Project.toml) file to your
    directory of choice. This file lists some of the most important packages used in the tutorial.
-   Start Julia by typing `julia` in the terminal.
-   In Julia, change working directory to your chosen directory by typing
    `cd("PathToYourDirectory")`.
-   In Julia, type `]` and press `Enter` to enter the package manager.
    The prompt should change to something with `pkg>`.
-   activate the environment by typing `activate .` and `Enter`. (that
    is `activate` followed by space and a dot).
-   still at the `pkg>` prompt, type `update` to install the most important packages for the tutorial, including Turing.jl. Go back to the `julia>` prompt by pressing `Backspace`.

If you want all packages used in the tutorial (takes longer) in exactly the same state as in my presentation, do this:

- Download the [Manifest.toml](Manifest.toml) file and place it in your
    directory of choice. This file list all packages and their dependencies with the same version used in the tutorial.
-   Start Julia by typing `julia` in the terminal.
-   In Julia, cd to your directory by typing
    `cd("PathToYourDirectory")`.
-   In Julia, type `]` and press `Enter` to enter the package manager.
    The prompt should change to something with `pkg>`.
-   activate the environment by typing `activate .` and `Enter`. (that
    is `activate` followed by space and a dot).
-   still at the `pkg>` prompt, type `instantiate` and `Enter` to install all packages used in the tutorial, with the exact same versions. Go back to the `julia>` prompt by pressing `Backspace`.
