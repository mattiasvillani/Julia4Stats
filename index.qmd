### Aim

This tutorial introduces the Julia programming language and its use for
statistical analysis. <br> The following topics will be covered:

-   introduction to the Julia programming language

-   the package manager and tooling

-   managing data in Julia

-   plots for statistics

-   statistical distributions

-   likelihood inference using numerical optimization

-   working with R and Python in Julia

-   probabilistic programming for statistical inference using Turing.jl

### Before the tutorial

You may want to install Julia and VS code before the tutorial, to follow
along in my interactive demos and also experiment yourself. I will not
assume that you have installed Julia however, and you can attend the
tutorial just to listen. See the first lecture for information on how to
install Julia and (optionally, but recommended, VS Code). If you want to
have the same packages and versions that I use in the tutorial, do this
after you have installed Julia:

-   Download the [Project.toml](Project.toml) and
    [Manifest.toml](Manifest.toml) files and place them in your
    directory of choice.
-   Start Julia by typing `julia` in the terminal.
-   In Julia, cd to your directory by typing
    `cd("PathToYourDirectory")`.
-   In Julia, type `]` and press `Enter` to enter the package manager.
    The prompt should change to something with `pkg>`.
-   activate the environment by typing `activate .` and `Enter`. (that
    is `activate` followed by space and a dot).
-   Instantiate the environment with all dependencies by typing
    `instantiate` and `Enter`. This will takes some time since many
    packages are installed and precompiled.
-   Press `Backspace` to exit the package manager.
